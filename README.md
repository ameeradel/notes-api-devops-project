# 🚀 Notes API DevOps Project

A production-focused DevOps project that demonstrates how to build, containerize, provision, deploy, expose, and monitor a Node.js Notes API using modern DevOps practices.

This project simulates a real-world DevOps workflow, covering:

- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes deployment on K3s
- Ingress-based traffic routing
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions
- Secure authentication using OIDC and kubeconfig
- Monitoring and observability

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a Notes API built with Node.js and PostgreSQL, deployed on a K3s cluster running on AWS infrastructure provisioned using Terraform.

It includes:

- Health, readiness, and metrics endpoints
- Kubernetes manifests for application and database
- NGINX Ingress Controller for routing
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- AWS ECR for private container images
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

## 🏗️ Architecture (K3s-based Deployment)

![Architecture](docs/images/App-architecture.png)

> High-level architecture showing how external traffic enters the cluster, is routed via the NGINX ingress controller, and reaches application pods and database services, with monitoring integrated.

````

## Architecture Notes

* Infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**
* Kubernetes cluster runs on **K3s**
* No cloud-managed load balancer is used
* Traffic enters through **ports 80 and 443**
* K3s ServiceLB forwards traffic to the **Ingress NodePort service**
* Internal communication uses **ClusterIP**

# 🐳 Local Development

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

## Access

* App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Health: [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health)
* Ready: [http://localhost:3000/ready](http://localhost:3000/ready)
* Metrics: [http://localhost:3000/metrics](http://localhost:3000/metrics)

# ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
kubectl get ingress
```

# 🌐 Traffic Exposure Model

This project uses **NGINX Ingress Controller** as the entry point for external traffic.

## Flow

1. User sends request to EC2 public IP on port 80/443
2. K3s ServiceLB receives the traffic
3. Traffic is forwarded to Ingress Controller (NodePort)
4. Ingress routes request to app-service
5. Request reaches application pods

## Key Point

This setup does NOT use a cloud load balancer.
It relies on **K3s internal load balancing (ServiceLB)**.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline & Authentication Flow

![CI/CD Pipeline](docs/images/app-cicd.png)

> Automated pipeline that builds, pushes, and deploys the application using secure authentication (OIDC) and Kubernetes deployment strategies.

## Responsibilities

* Build Docker image
* Authenticate securely to AWS using OIDC
* Push image to ECR
* Authenticate to Kubernetes using kubeconfig
* Update deployment
* Trigger rolling update

---

# 🔐 Authentication & Access Model

This project uses a multi-layer secure authentication approach.

## 1. GitHub → AWS (OIDC)

* Uses OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* No static AWS credentials stored
* GitHub assumes IAM role
* Temporary credentials are issued

## 2. CI/CD → Kubernetes (kubeconfig)

Used for:

* `kubectl apply`
* `kubectl set image`
* `kubectl rollout status`

Defines:

* Cluster endpoint
* Credentials
* Context

## 3. Kubernetes → ECR (Image Pull)

* Cluster pulls images from private ECR
* Access is restricted and controlled

---

## 🔐 Security Summary

* No long-lived credentials
* Temporary AWS access via OIDC
* Controlled cluster access
* Private container registry

---

# 📊 Monitoring & Observability

* Prometheus scrapes `/metrics`
* Grafana visualizes metrics

## Metrics

* HTTP request count
* Request duration
* System/runtime metrics

---

# 🛠️ Infrastructure Provisioning

Infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**.

This ensures:

* Repeatability
* Consistency
* Automation of AWS resources

---

# 🧠 DevOps Practices Demonstrated

* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
* Containerization
* Kubernetes orchestration
* Ingress routing
* CI/CD automation
* Secure authentication (OIDC + kubeconfig)
* Observability
* Production-ready design

---

# 🚧 Future Improvements

* Migrate to EKS
* Add Helm
* Implement Argo CD (GitOps)
* Use AWS Secrets Manager
* Add Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
* Move database to RDS
